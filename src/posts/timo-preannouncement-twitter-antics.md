Yesterday, we did a little experiment to "pre-announce" Timo to the world. I mean, we've been live for over two years. We've been tweeting about our progress for the last 12 months. We've been hitting that thing with screenshots as we go. But never from the official account, and never in a thought out manner.

We wanted to get a glimpse of what will happen when we launch. Given we started sending beta invites to our mailing list last week too, we thought it time to show Timo off a little more.

I wrote a thread. <a href="https://twitter.com/jordanamblin" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jordan</a> made some snazzy videos. We sent it. And here are the results:

- 6232 impressions
- 386 engagements (6.19% of impressions)
- 8 new twitter followers (0.12% of impressions, 2.07% of engagements)
- 18 visits (0.28% of impressions, 4.66% of engagements)
- 7 mailing list sign ups (0.11%, 1.81% of engagements, 38.88% of visits)
- 3 new beta users (0.04%, 16.66 of visits)

To put this into perspective. The introduction tweet had 21 likes and 14 retweets. We got there with a Twitter following of ~1300, split across Timo (18), Jordan (~800) and me (~480). With a little boost from our friends too.

This means a whole load of people, 6232 to be exact, have seen Timo. That's more than any day since the <a href="https://medium.com/@rdjpalmer/why-i-started-doing-side-projects-a1400ea3e48b#f868" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">aftermath of the v1 launch</a>.

The numbers afterwards are low. But they're not disappointing.

Timo is a niche product. More niche than other task lists, and other time trackers. It solves a specific problem, and we talk about it in a specific way.

The insight for us right now is that of the 18 people we managed to convert into visitors, our conversion rate to the mailing list and beta users is awesome. Keeping conversion at that rate would be something special.
