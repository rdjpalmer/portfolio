Sitting at a blank screen is a sure fire way to make you feel inadequate.

Your anxiety takes over, thinking about how the people you care about will judge you. And so you continue to sit there. Continue staring at the blank screen. Cursor blinking.

Cursor.

Blinking.

Yet you find yourself in a different world. One, where some of your worst nightmares have come true. Where your reputation is in tatters and you feel alone. Ever so alone.

You stare a little more. You get fidgety. Your unconscious is trying to escape the chair and leave your body behind. You are still there though, still staring.

Then, things take a turn. You get caught up in the hundreds of chores you could be doing instead.
You notice a coffee stain on the desk that needs cleaning.

Your phone goes off. Quick. Check it. It could be an emergency.

Now you feel a little thirsty. Well, very thirsty. Your throat is dry. You're coughing up sand. Water, coffee, any liquid, please, God, now, make it stop.

You glance at your clock, and a few seconds have past since you sat down to write your masterpiece. You take a deep breathe and type some words:

"Sitting at a blank screen"...
