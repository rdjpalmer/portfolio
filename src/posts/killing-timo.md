  We’ve been working hard at killing our side project, Timo. Yes, you read that right. Killing our side project.
I suspect you’re asking the question, “Why?”. Here is the answer.

We’ve been working hard at killing our side project, <a href="https://hellotimo.co/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Timo</a>. Yes, you read that right. Killing our side project.

I suspect you’re asking the question, “Why?”. We must dislike the idea, or lack passion for it. If that were true, we would have stopped working on it ages ago. We don’t want that. We don’t want to stop without good reason.

Trying to kill Timo gives us a different perspective to validating it as an idea. One which means we can evaluate what we do, why we do it, and be ruthless in stopping anything that isn’t working.

It’s about testing Timo’s resolve by tackling the hardest problems first. Like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pre-mortem" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">doing a pre-mortem</a>, where you resolve the biggest and scariest problems first. Where you reduce your risk by tackling these issues head on. It’s a lens which guides our decision making, so we learn what we need to know as fast as possible.

## The killer lens

Like all indie makers, we’re not afforded the luxuries that come with venture capital. We’ve no runway and both Jordan and I are working full time jobs. This isn’t a complaint, but a statement of the facts. We can’t chase market share, we can’t use aggressive (and expensive) marketing tactics. We have to depend on the cheap or free options and find hours where we can. We have hard constraints to work within.

These constraints mean that time wastage has a significant impact on our chance to succeed. By viewing our mission as trying to kill Timo, we can be ruthless in our decision making.

An example of this is how easy it is to push back on scope. It’s easy to get bogged down building feature after feature, in the hope that we strike gold with ‘the next one’. But we’re trying to kill it. We don’t have time to build the next feature. We need to know if people will use and pay for it now.

Avoiding perfectionism is easy too. We’re trying to kill Timo, so there’s no need to present a polished application to anyone. Bugs are fine. Shipping early iterations of a feature is a-ok. For as long as it’s out there and teaching us what we need to know.

## Negative framing

When we frame it as ‘killing Timo’, what we’re looking for is a good reason we shouldn’t continue building it. A strong enough signal to say, okay, our vision doesn’t fit the reality of the world. That it’s time to call it quits. What does success look like? The lack of a reason to do so.

We frame it negatively because fear is among the most powerful of emotions. We’re not kidding ourselves that Timo is going to be a success. But we’re fearful that we may expend all of our energy chasing the wrong rabbit.

If the moment comes, we won’t be scared to stop and move on.

And if we fail? Hard luck. We’ve created a successful business.
