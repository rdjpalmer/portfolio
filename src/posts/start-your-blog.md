  "How to start a blog". Write one post. Publish it. Share it. No more excuses. Get on with it already!

In an unexpected turn of events, a number of my team at TransferWise have set out to start blogs. Actually. It's not that unexpected if you count the times I’ve spoken to someone who wants to start one. Seems everyone **wants** to, but very few go on to.

I guess the idea is nice. A place to solidify then share your thinking. But the actual process is hard. I’m not yet prolific, but here I am, giving advice on the topic.
Starting is straight forward.

Write one post. Publish it. Share it.

Like anything else, it’s too easy to procrastinate. It’s the designer conundrum which stops them from getting their portfolio finished. Starting a blog? Nah, can’t have a blog until you’ve got the perfect design. Can’t have a blog without content first. Can't have a blog with only one post.

They’re all excuses. Write a post. Put it **somewhere.** You can change that somewhere after. That’s the easy part.

If you're capable of writing HTML, you have all the prerequisites for publishing a blog:

1. Write a post
2. Convert to HTML
3. Host it

Done that? Buy a domain and point it at your static website. Not okay with the browser styles? Add some CSS. The point is it to publish it first, **then** iterate. You've been afford the luxury of being a beginner. You're at the beginning of your journey. Make the most of it. You don't have readers to piss off. You don't have anyone questioning why things aren't as good as they could be. As Shia LaBeouf proclaimed, **just do it**.

Write one post. Publish it. Share it.
