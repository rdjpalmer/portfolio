  "How to start a blog". Write one post. Publish it. Share it. No more excuses. Get on with it already!
---

In an unexpected turn of events, a number of my team at TransferWise have set out to start blogs. Actually. It's not that unexpected if you count the times I’ve spoken to someone who wants to start one. Seems everyone **wants** to, but very few go on to.

I guess the idea is nice. A place to share your solidify then share your thinking. But the actual process of it is hard. I’m not even prolific, yet here I am, trying to give advice on the topic.
But starting is straight forward.

Write one post. Publish it. Share it.

Like honestly, it’s so easy to procrastinate your way to never having a blog. It’s the classic designer conundrum which stops them from getting their portfolio website finished. They want to redesign it immediately. A blog? Nah, can’t have a blog until you’ve got the perfect design. Can’t have a blog without content first. Can't have a blog with only post post either.

They’re all excuses. Write a post. Put it **somewhere.** You can change that somewhere after. That’s the easy part.

If you're capable of writing HTML, you have all the prerequisites for publishing a blog:

1. Write a post
2. Convert to HTML
3. Host it

Done that? Buy a domain and point it at your static website. Not okay with the browser styles? Add some CSS. The point is it to publish it first, **then** iterate. You've been afford the luxury of being a beginner. You're at the beginning of your journey. Make the most of it. You don't have readers to piss off. You don't have anyone questioning why things aren't as good as they could be. As Shia LaBeouf proclaimed, **just do it**.

What did I say?

Write one post. Publish it. Share it.

Write one post. Publish it. Share it.

Now you're blogging.
