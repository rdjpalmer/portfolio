Hey there,

Unsurprisingly, Revolut have been making headlines again. Not only for
<a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2019/02/28/revolut-failed-block-suspicious-transactions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">turning a blind eye to money laundering and theft</a>,
but also for
<a href="https://www.wired.co.uk/article/revolut-trade-unions-labour-fintech-politics-storonsky" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">how poorly they treat their staff and users</a>.

I, unfortunately, was a customer of theirs for a little while, but have since
deleted my account. That experience alone was terrible, forcing me to speak to a
real person and confirm all of my details. All this, despite requesting deletion
from within the application, which is also locked behind Face ID. I get it. Make
it as difficult as possible for users to delete their account and you're more
likely to keep them around. It's a classic trick employed by phone companies,
cable TV companies and anyone stuck in the dark age of vanity metrics. Happily,
there's been a trend towards monthly subscriptions with no lock in. But even
that trend is hampered by difficult cancellation processes, dark patterns or
offers to keep you around.

I believe customers should have every right to cancel their account with you at
any moment. In fact, at a time when it can take you 10 seconds to open a bank
account (my house mate's Business account took this long), surely we should aim
to make leaving just as easy.

So this is my new rule of thumb: **make cancelling your account as easy, if not
easier, than opening it**.

Sure, you might lose more customers, but they'll leave with a much better
opinion of you. And that opinion counts. These are people who'll still spread
the word if they enjoyed your product. They're the people who'll be complaining
to their friends if it's a complete shit show too. Give them a good experience,
even when leaving, and they'll be more likely to return another time.

Kai Forsyth, a Product Designer at Intercom,
<a href="https://www.intercom.com/blog/designing-user-offboarding/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">recently wrote about this very topic</a>,
and goes much deeper than this email. Though I'd caveat this with the fact I
disagree when it comes to desperately trying to keep the user onboard by showing
them what they'll be missing out on.

Have a strong opinion of revolut? Or maybe you've got similar rules you follow?
I'd been keen to hear themâ€”just hit reply.

Until next time,

Richard
