"The right dimensions are those that are sufficient with minimum effort. The measure of our objects should therefore be a human measure" - Mart Stam.

A reminder that, while we're creating, we're creating for humans. And it's those needs which we should be catering for first. That perhaps, while we measure the success of our projects in the number of people using it, or the revenue it generates that these are merely a proxy for what we should measuring.

Rather, we should measure the impact our creations have on individuals. Something which has a profound impact of a few is just as valid as one which impacts the many to a lesser extent.

It's why making things intentionally smaller than they could be, is not necessarily a bad idea. <a href="https://twitter.com/thesephist/status/1327643453182914560" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Linus and Sarv make this assertion about communities</a> while I'm having frequent conversations with other indie makers about how staying small can be the most rewarding.
