“The right dimensions are those that are sufficient with minimum effort. The measure of our objects should therefore be a human measure” - Mart Stam.

A reminder that, while we’re building anything, we’re building it for people. And it’s those people’s needs we should be addressing.

Most businesses measure their success by the number of people using it, or the revenue it generates. They’re great indicators. In reality they’re proxies. Proxies for the impact they’ve had on people’s lives. Which is what really matters.

To say this in another way, something which has a profound impact on a few is as valid, if not more so, than something which has a wider reach but lesser effect.

Linus and Sarvasv make this point about communities. That the most valuable communities are smaller and tight knit. At the smaller size, each person gets more value from their participation.

Keeping your project small could be the smart choice. With it, you can bring more care and attention. In return, you get more freedom to do as you see fit, and foster better relationships.

Though I haven’t read it yet, I’ve heard good things (and some mixed reviews) about <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Company-One-Staying-Small-Business/dp/0241380227/ref=sr_1_2?dchild=1&qid=1605461593&refinements=p_27%3APaul+Jarvis&s=books&sr=1-2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Company of One</a>, Paul Jarvis’s book on this very topic.

Right now, I'm happily in the camp of keeping things small. But I'd love to know what you think. <a href="https://twitter.com/rdjpalmer" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hit me up on twitter</a>, or hit reply to my newsletter.
