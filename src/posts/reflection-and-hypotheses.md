Hey there,

You may have missed issue four a couple of weeks ago, due to a technical hitch
with TinyLetter. The subject line was replaced with "Friends, Romans,
countrymen, lend me your ears". Fortunately, if you're not up for trawling
through your inbox for it (I understand, we're all busy people), you can
[find it in the archives](/separate-the-people-from-the-problem).

Now, onto the meat of this issue...

Recently, I've had a few conversations about a side project I shipped last year,
which I'd like to share with you. That side project was
[Timo](https://hellotimo.co/), a todo and time tracking application for
creatives who have to fill out time sheets. Looking back, all the signs are
promising. We launched a MVP which got some decent traction. Since shipping,
we've had over 7000 people use the app, nearly 100,000 tracked events and
continue to have users despite not tending to the application or the people
using it. Sure, these are vanity metrics, but they go some way to suggesting it
would be worth pursuing further. The interest exists. But it also leaves some
big question marks: what's the actual problem we're solving? Would people pay
for it? Is it possible to turn it into something more valuable for the people
using it and it's creators? These are the answers we need to find.

In essence, the first step is to define a hypothesis. The second is to define a
method to test it. Let's take the "would people pay for it?" question, and
reframe it. The hypothesis becomes:

People will pay for Timo.

To test this, we could:

1. Contact our current users and ask them if they would pay
2. Setup a kickstarter and have people commit their money towards a new shiny
   version of Timo
3. Find where our audience may hang out and offer them life time access in
   return for a nominal fee
4. The list is endless, but to keep this short...

One of these may prove enough to find the answers we're looking for, to inform
our decision making. CEO & Founder of <a href="https://tryjupiter.com/">Jupiter</a>, Helen
Tran wrote about this in
<a href="http://helentran.com/notetakingandaccountability" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Note-taking and Accountability</a>.

To decide whether it's go time with Timo, or another opportunity, the real trick
is figuring out what to test first. This, I believe, is where ideation and
intuition plays a big part.

Take an idea you have, and turn it into as many hypotheses and null hypotheses
as possible. Then, prioritise them by what you think will make or break the
idea. Pick one or two from the top of the list, and focus all your efforts in
creating a test to prove them. They're now your guiding light.

I'm going to use this process imminently with Timo and some other less fleshed
out ideas. I'll let you know how it goes...
