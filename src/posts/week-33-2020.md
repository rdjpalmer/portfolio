## On life

Off the back of a recommendation from a colleague at TransferWise, I find myself taking Zinc. Itâ€™s an attempt at staving off the feeling of fatigue that Iâ€™ve been dealing with on-and-off for over two years now. Iâ€™m very curious to see how it pans outâ€”so far, so good.

## On writing

Iâ€™ve also been thinking quite a bit how I can continue improving my writing. Iâ€™ve realised my biggest gap is in the depths of the ideas.

A lot of what Iâ€™ve written so far is quite shallow. Iâ€™ve failed to really take an idea and explore it fully. I suspect this is due to not doing enough reading around a topic. That is, Iâ€™m not doing enough research.

Inspired by <a href="https://nesslabs.com/how-to-read-a-book" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ness Labâ€™s How to read a book</a>, Iâ€™m rectifying this by taking a whole lot more notes while reading. Iâ€™m starting with <a href="https://rolfpotts.com/books/vagabonding/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Vagabonding by Rolf Potts</a>, and accompanying it with a bunch of post-it notes, using them as my bookmark and notepad.

On each post it, I write page numbers, quotes and any offshoot ideas that I have while reading. Iâ€™ll then write these up into <a href="https://roamresearch.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Roam Research</a>, when Iâ€™m done reading for the day.

And I can already see its influence, as Iâ€™ve begun writing a more indepth version of <a href="http://rdjpalmer.com/quick-and-shit">Quick and Shit</a>. Though itâ€™s taking a little while to become accustomed to the fact that the process is now a whole lot longer.

Iâ€™ve started a <a href="https://twitter.com/rdjpalmer/status/1294966933801099264"  target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">thread on the resources, tips and guides</a> Iâ€™m using to get better at research.

## On Timo

While most of the recent work is still being tested, weâ€™re making good progress with <a href="https://hellotimo.co">Timoâ€™s</a> Overview page. Compared to where we were just two weeks ago, itâ€™s come a long way and should now be a lot easier to use and digest. Weâ€™ll be sharing it without beta users very soon.

The good news is that with the Overview page starting to shape up, weâ€™re gearing up for onboarding our first beta users. If youâ€™re on the email list, expect an invite in the next few weeks <span role="img" aria-label="tada emoji">ðŸŽ‰</a>

Weâ€™ve also got our act together with the roadmap. Having set up a Notion Roadmap and Backlog, which handles a lot of prioritisation for us. We plan on sharing a template and more information on that soon.

Also worth noting how useful <a href="https://notion.so" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Notion</a> can be for start ups. For those pages that you donâ€™t necessarily care too much about how they look, using public Notion pages is a great way to bootstrap a content-management system. Weâ€™ve started using it for our public changelog and legalese pages <span role="img" aria-label="sparkle emoji">âœ¨</span>

## On TransferWise

At TransferWise, Iâ€™ve been exploring Webpack 5â€™s new Module Federation feature. Thanks to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DHjZnJRK_S8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jack Harringtonâ€™s introductory videos</a>, we have a working example of a TransferWise app with module federation and a first draft of a blog post on the topic. Itâ€™s pretty exciting, as it should allow us to cut our micro-frontendsâ€™ bundle sizes down significantlyâ€”something we need a great deal.

In other news, TransferWise are hiring again after the recent Coronavirus hiring freeze. Weâ€™ve had the incredible privilege of avoiding the need to make redundancies, and itâ€™s amazing to see how quickly weâ€™ve recovered. If youâ€™re looking for a job, and <a href="https://www.transferwise.jobs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">find a vacancy that looks appealing to you</a>, <a href="mailto:rich@rdjpalmer.com">hit me up</a> and letâ€™s have a conversation!
