Hey friend,

Thank you for taking a moment to lend me your attention. Now you're here, you're probably wondering who I am.

I'm Richard, co-creator of [Timo](https://hellotimo.co) (putting your tasks and time tracking in one place) and tech lead for [TransferWise's](https://transferwise.com) conversion team (thats people, not money).

Previously I started Byozo (a productivity methodology complete with supporting app, now defunct), having worked at various
start ups including [Appear Here](https://appearhere.co.uk) and
[Pact Coffee](https://www.pactcoffee.com/).

This is home to my writing on business, technology, and communication.
