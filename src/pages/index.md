# Hey there ðŸ‘‹

I previously made co-maker of Timo (a defunct application for putting your tasks and time tracking in one place) and currently writing for fun and rediscovering what it means to be human ~~experimenting with new projects and the journey to my first passive dollar~~.

Previously I started Byozo (a defunct productivity methodology with supporting app), lead the Conversion team at [Wise](https://wise.com) and worked for [Appear Here](https://appearhere.co.uk) and
[Pact Coffee](https://www.pactcoffee.com/).

Here's home to all my musings. Feel free to reach out <a href="mailto:rich@rdjpalmer.com">via email</a>.
