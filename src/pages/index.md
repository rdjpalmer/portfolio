# Hey, I'm Richard

I'm co-maker of [Timo](https://hellotimo.co) (putting your tasks and time tracking in one place) and currently experimenting with new projects and the journey to my first passive dollar.

Previously I started Byozo (a defunct productivity methodology with supporting app), lead the Conversion team at [Wise](https://wise.com) and worked for [Appear Here](https://appearhere.co.uk) and
[Pact Coffee](https://www.pactcoffee.com/).

This is home to my writings on business, technology, life and communication.
