# Hey, I&apos;m Richard

I'm the co-creator of time and task manager, [Timo](https://hellotimo.co),
filling the gap between work done, work logged and the time sheet. Currently leading the Conversion (think people, not money) team at [TransferWise](https://transferwise.com).

Over the last eight years, I've taken a leading role in engineering and design
for the likes of [Byozo](https://byozo.org), [nudj](https://twitter.com/nudjHQ),
[Appear Here](https://appearhere.co.uk) and
[Pact Coffee](https://www.pactcoffee.com/).

Feel free to [email me](mailto:rich@rdjpalmer.com), or
[DM me on twitter](https://twitter.com/rdjpalmer).
