  Sometimes, you'll need to do your learning in a safe environment, away from
  prying eyes. Away from too much judgement. That isn't to say, you should work in
  private either. Rather, it's to look at the situation in a different light; how
  can you get the best of both worlds?

Hey there,

I wanted to start with a massive thank you for subscribing to my newsletter. To
tell you the absolute truth, I started it as I'm a tad insecure with my writing.
I've tried blogging,
[as recently as the other day](https://medium.com/@rdjpalmer/get-more-people-to-say-yes-ec8d7590e159),
but I've never felt comfortable doing it. I'd find that I'd write one piece I
was happy with, then fail with the next. I'd struggle to find any consistency
with it.

My good friend Jamie Syke has written about the
[importance of sharing your work](https://blog.prototypr.io/please-share-your-fucking-work-12fb72b26e5f).
And I agree whole heartedly. But when you're at the beginning of your learning,
sometimes it isn't all that easy.

Sometimes, you'll need to do your learning in a safe environment, away from
prying eyes. Away from too much judgement. That isn't to say, you should work in
private either. Rather, it's to look at the situation in a different light; how
can you get the best of both worlds?

And that's the challenge. When faced with a problem where conventional wisdom
isn't cutting it, break it down. By breaking it down into it's constituent
parts, you can better address it.

Let's take blogging as an example. I wanted to work in public, to have a
feedback loop with my readers. Yet I struggle with the blog format. To find
consistency with the posts. So why not change the format? That's how I came to
the conclusion of starting this newsletter. It gives me the benefits of blogging
and also gives me a safe space to experiment in. I'm able to speak freely with
people I trust, who have elected to listen to my ramblings.

It's worth approaching all problems like this. To identify the smaller problems
it's made up of, and look for solutions to those instead. It's likely you'll
find the original problem is a lot smaller than you thought, and the solution
much simpler.

I'd like to thank you again, for giving me a place to share my writing, and for
your patience. You're helping me learn; so I'd like to return the favour. If
you're facing a problem—be that with your work, learning or anything else—let me
know, and we can work together to break it down.

Until next time,

Richard
