  A process for working creatively and efficiently
---

Hey there,

You may have noticed you’ve been getting more emails from me. For better or
worse, I’m trying to be even more frequent with my writing. I hope that’s okay
with you!

I had a great conversation yesterday about how I work: quick and shit.

I found myself following "quick and shit" mostly through my programming. On
reflection, it's actually a great way to approach most things which require any
creativity.

It's quite simple. With programming as the example, it looks like this:

First, write your code quickly and don't care how it looks or performs. This
lets you understand whether or not the thing you’re making is actually useful or
not. Second—having passed the early test—bring it up to your (hopefully)
rigorously high standards.

In programming, there’s a notion of premature abstraction. It’s where
complexities are hidden away before all use cases are addressed, making it
harder to use rather than easier. Quick and shit avoids this by getting
something that /works/ first and can be abstracted later.

Move fast and break things is Facebook’s classic mantra. Similarly, startups
bang on and on about testing with prototypes before building the real thing.
Quick and shit expedites this by bringing it to your own work.

When you’re trying to solve any problem, it’s common place to debate the
solutions as they come up. Raising “what ifs” about each idea immediately is a
sure fire way to end up with the worst idea. Damaging each idea from its
inception rather than understanding the full lay of the land. Quick and shit
means surfacing many ideas first before working through them and evaluating them
fairly.

Maybe you’re writing a blog post? It’s tempting to edit each sentence as it’s
written. But that leads to the same problem. You’re halting the flow of ideas
before you’re exhausted of them. You’re not ready to edit yet. Take this
newsletter as an example: the version you’re reading barely resembles the first
draft. Spending time poring over each word would mean I could have easily missed
the message and ended up with something vastly different. Quick and shit means
all avenues have been explored and the final piece is 10x better.

Quick and shit doesn’t mean shit forever. It means getting out what’s in your
head and seeing how it fairs in the real world. Ideas, designs, code, whatever
it is always shows it’s true colours when it’s out of your head. Give it a try,
let me know how it goes.
