  Don't be misled by your data

What you're measuring doesn't makes sense on its own. For a SaaS product, a high number of registrations doesn't mean success. A high number of registrations, low churn and turning a profit means success.

As Andrew Grove's says in <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/High-Output-Management-Andrew-Grove/dp/0679762884/ref=sr_1_1?crid=3FEWRXR5M6SJU&keywords=high+output+management&qid=1573592913&s=books&sprefix=high+%2Cstripbooks%2C139&sr=1-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">High Output Management</a>, it's pivotal to pair metrics to avoid over optimising your business in the wrong ways:

- registrations (users in) → churn (users out)
- conversion rate (%) → new customers (absolute numbers)
- inventory count → # of times orders went unfulfilled
