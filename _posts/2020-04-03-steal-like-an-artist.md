Austin Kleon's short read **has** a moment of inspiration on almost every page. Possibly the first time I've found myself reading passages aloud to my girlfriend, with the advise so applicable to discussions we've had recently.

Go deep, be curious. You don't have to have the answers right now. But turn up, do your work and make decisions, even if they're wrong. It's the difference between striding forwards and being stuck.

It's the same message I found in <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/615570.The_Artist_s_Way" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Artist's Way</a>. Show up, do your work. Things will happen. Maybe what you try is not right for you, but that's progress. That's how you find your way to the thing that is __your__ thing.
