Hey there,

Going by the title alone, you'd expect this to be about software development. If
you do, you'd be kind of right, but mostly wrong.

Let me set the seen:

In recent times, I've started trying to get into better shape. I decided to try
my hand at CrossFit[1], going to my local gym,
[The Yard](http://www.theyardpeckham.com/). I've been working at it since the
turn of the year and have started to understand the finer details of what it
takes to succeed.

Why is this relevant? Well, a common topic I've mused on over my career is that
of over working and burnout. Having now seen the state of the fitness industry
and their approach to peak performance, it's clear: startup culture is
lightyears behind.

Maybe you've encountered the terms "programming", "rest days" and "recovery".
What I'm sure of, is it's never been in relation to mental exercise. Always
working out, lifting weights and running marathons.

These terms are staight forward enough. Programming is the plan you follow for
your workouts. Programmes have rest days built in, to allow your body to fully
recover. This means bigger gains and less chance of injury.

Before any of this matters, you need to address your basic needs. Work on these
and they'll give you a foundation to build upon:

1. Sleep
2. Nutrition
3. Health
4. Stress reduction

It would be easy to write thousands and thousands of words on each of these
topics. Let's assume you're able to figure it out... and with the foundation
set, we can begin to focus our efforts on the "work" itself. In the fitness
world, thats your training. In my domain, that's software development or product
design.

You'll find most software or product teams operate in some variation of a
"sprint".
[Originating from scrum](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/scrum/sprints), but
never following scrum's practices. The problem here is sprints are never ending.
The closest you get to a break between them is a short session of planning and a
retrospective. It's like you're running a marathon at a 100 metre pace. It's
madness. No wonder people in software burn out so frequently.

It's time this changed.

How? Simple. Build in recovery time into the workout regime.

Brett Jones at StrongFirst talks in length about
[cultivating recovery](https://www.strongfirst.com/cultivating-recovery/). His
answer? Proper programming. In other words, being proactive in building in "down
time" into plans. It'll ensure everyone has a chance to recover between intense
work.

Realistically, this doesn't have to mean stopping. It can mean changing your
focus, and working a different part of your mind.

Ran out of steam programming? It's the perfect time to clear out your inbox.
Stuck on a design problem? Open that book on accessibility and get reading. It's
the subtle change in tasks that'll keep you fresh for longer, and still
productive.

Of course, I'm not suggesting you should always continue working your mind.
Proper rest will always beat more work whatever that work is. But it's one way I
find it possible to get more done without feeling overwhelmed. Doing so
proactively, before you reach the wall, is even more beneficial.

I'd love to see more emphasis placed on recovery by organisations. Ensuring
sprints are not 5 days a week, 52 weeks a year. By building "rest" between
projects more. It doesn't have to mean zero work done but can mean prioritising
different work.

Let me know your thoughts,

Richard
