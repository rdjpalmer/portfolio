## Back story

I've been missing the adrenaline caused by <a href="http://www.theyardpeckham.com/#textboxupye0si" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gareth</a> setting the countdown clock for the imminent workout. The impending doom caused by the beeps, the final warning before having to sweat your heart out for the next ten minutes.

Me & Lyd have been trying to keep ourselves healthy since the UK went into lockdown by doing circuits around our living room (so many press-ups <span role="img" aria-label="sob">ðŸ˜­</span>), but one thing that was missing was the clock staring you in the face saying "you're not even half way through yet, keep going!"

I'm sure you're thinkingâ€”as did Iâ€”that you can use your phone. Or Google would return *exactly the right thing*. You'd be correct on both. But neither are very fun, and none of them are nice enough that you *want* to be looking at them at all.

I thought I'd give it a go, and build my own. A classic Software Engineer thing to do. But here we go:

## Details, details

"For time" is an expression used in the CrossFit world for a work out against the clock.

Fortime (the website this post is about) turned out to be more art than engineering. It's the first time in awhile I've just let things happen. I was not consciously designing fortime in this aesthetic. It was pure chance I started to make the time display in neon, which led me to make it Tron-esk.

For the inspiration that started it all off, you'll find a couple of Codepens below.

Fortime is open source <a href="https://github.com/rdjpalmer/fortime" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">on GitHub</a>, with a concepts directory with some early experimentation with the neon effect in the last codeine.

It's made with <a href="https://svelte.dev/" target="_blank"  rel="noopener noreferrer">Svelte</a>, after I thought it was about time I tried something different to (<a href="https://preactjs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">p</a>)<a href="https://reactjs.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">react</a>. From my very brief foray into Svelte, I can only report back good things.
